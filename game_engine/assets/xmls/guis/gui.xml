			<window> is the tag used to specify the creation of a window.
			
			Attributes:
				name:	The name of the window being created.
				type:	The type of window(or widget) to be created.
				look:	The looknfeel to apply to this window/widget.

				<location> is the tag specified to set this window's
				position in regards to its parent window.
				
				Attributes:
					relative:	Refers to the relative position offsets for x and y
								for this window.
					absolute:	Refers to the absolute pixel offsets for x and y for
								this window.
					
					
					<location relative="xr,yr" absolute="xa,ya"/>
					xr is relative x position to the parent window.
					yr is relative y position to the parent window.
					xa is absolute x position to the parent window.
					ya is absolute y position to the parent window.
					Relative is percentage offset for parent window.
					Absolute is pixel offset for parent window.
					
					
					So if the tag is as below:
					<location relative="0.25,0.25" absolute="10.0, 0.0"/>
					The window's x relative offset is 25% of the distance from the left
					side of its parent window to the right side of its parent.  The
					absolute offset of 10 pixels for x offsets it an additional 10 pixels
					from that.
					The newly created window's y offset would be 25% of the distance from
					the top to the bottom of its parent window.

				<area> is the tag specifying how large this window is.
				
				Attributes:
					relative:	How large this window is relative to its parent.
					aboslute:	How large this window is pixel wise.
					
				<area relative="xr,yr" absolute="xa,ya"/>
				xr is relative width of this window in percentage of parent window's
					width it is covering.
				yr is relative height for this window in percentage of parent window's
					height it is covering.
				xa is absolute width for this window in pixels.
				ya is absolute height for this window in pixels.
